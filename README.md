# Xcode File Templates

Some quick templates for [Mew](https://github.com/mercari/Mew) in Xcode.
MicroViewControllers are awesome!

## Installation
Xcode looks for templates in the `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates` directory. To install, just clone this repository inside that directory.

```bash
# Clone the Mew templates into a directory named 'Mew' inside the templates directory.
git clone git@github.com:yenom/Xcode-Templates-Mew.git ~/Library/Developer/XCode/Templates/Mew
```
